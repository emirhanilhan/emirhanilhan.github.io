      <description>1. Carbon Tail Risk, w/ Zacharias Sautner and Grigory Vilkov Review of Financial Studies, March 2021, 34(3), 1540-1571.
- IQ-KAP ESG Research Prize - ESG Special Award 
AbstractStrong regulatory actions are needed to combat climate change, but uncertainty makes it difficult for investors to quantify the impact of future climate regulation. We show that climate policy uncertainty is priced in the option market. The cost of option protection against downside tail risks is larger for firms with more carbon-intense business models.</description>

      <description>I taught the introductory Mathematics course in the Bachelor in the Business Administration program in Fall 2017 and Fall 2018. The course covered linear algebra, optimization, and differential and integral calculus.
In Fal 2022, I taught a portion of the Foundations of Finance course in the Master of Finance program and conducted tutorial sessions involving problem set solutions. As the title of the course suggests, the course covered the fundamentals of corporate finance and asset valuation.</description>

      <description>1. Climate Risk Disclosure and Institutional Investors, w/ Philipp Krueger, Zacharias Sautner, and Laura Starks
Review of Financial Studies, Revise and Resubmit
- Finalist for the John L. Weinberg/IRRCi Research Award 
AbstractEmploying disclosure theory, we develop hypotheses regarding the preferences of institutional investors with respect to firms’ climate risk disclosures. Through a survey and empirical tests, we test these hypotheses and provide systematic evidence suggesting that institutional investors value and demand climate risk disclosures, that climate-specific disclosure costs and benefits affect these demands, and that influence and selection effects explain the equilibrium relations between institutional ownership and disclosure.</description>
